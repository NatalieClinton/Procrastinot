## Description

As a project team member, I created kanban task baord that allows me to add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly.

## The Creation

I created this repository which includes all the neccesary files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As requested, when the task board is opened, the the list of project tasks are displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed). When viewing the task board for the project, each task is color-coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or overdue (red). When clicking on the button to define a new task, a modal dialog allows entering the title, description, and deadline date for the new task. When clicking the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage. When dragging a task to a different progress column, the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will remain in the new column after refreshing. When clicking the delete button for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing. When refreshing the page, the saved tasks persist..
